<!-- Similarities and differences between defer and module:

Both wait until the DOM is parsed before running → so no “DOM not ready” problems.

But the key difference is:

defer: classic script, globals go to window.

type="module": isolated module scope, nothing goes to window unless you put it there. -->



<!-- Why modules are designed this way

If modules automatically polluted the global scope, they’d break the whole point of modular code.

The idea is:

You explicitly export things from one file.

You explicitly import them in another.

No more accidental global leaks like old-school JS.

✅ So in short:

defer = runs after DOM is ready + still global.

type="module" = runs after DOM is ready + private scope.

That’s why your inline onclick works with defer but not with type="module". -->
