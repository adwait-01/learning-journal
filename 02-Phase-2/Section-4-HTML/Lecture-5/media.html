    <!-- ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications- If we want to make any web application very rich so that any device can actually operate and any device can serve that , that's where we take care of the ARIA.
     
    For e.g. If we make an web application for governments or banks etc, we come and study the ARIA labels to see what should be taken care of.
    For e.g. Whether our website is applicable only through keyboards, or only by speech recognition, etc. -->
