<!-- See, hunt, debug.  -->
<!-- Whenever we are learning things, look for the errors. Look for it, hunt for it. Debug it. Once we debug things, we are able to debug faster and learn more. Programming is less about coding and more about debugging.  
 This is the difference between senior and junior developers. Seniors have seen enough of the problem to go hunt for it and look at exact place where the problem appears. -->
