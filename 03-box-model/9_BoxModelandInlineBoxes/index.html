    <!-- In the example below, we have a <span> inside a paragraph. We have applied a width, height, margin, border, and padding to it. 
    You can see that the width and height are ignored. The top and bottom margin, padding, and border are respected but don't change the relationship 
    of other content to our inline box. The padding and border overlap other words in the paragraph. 
    The left and right padding, margins, and borders move other content away from the box. -->

    <p>I am a paragraph and this is a <span>span</span> inside that paragraph. A span
    is an inline element and so does not respect width and height.
