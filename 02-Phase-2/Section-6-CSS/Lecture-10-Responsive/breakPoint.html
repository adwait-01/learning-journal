      Once you define your breakpoints, you start working on the views that you want. 
      If you want to hide certain elements on the mobile screen, you go ahead and select those classes and set the display property to none. 
      If you want the text is pretty big, you want the smaller text, you select that text element, reduce down the font and on the bigger screen, it automatically becomes bigger */
