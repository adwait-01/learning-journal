<!-- because of live server extension, or "serve" because of nodejs, the website i opened was in http which is the less secure version of https. 
but opening the index.html file without the live server is causing the link to be file:// something like this which is not http at all.
and then using just src without "defer" or type=module makes it run fine on file:// links but causes problem when defined in the head tag because the DOM is 
not initialized until then.
when we use "defer" or use the script src tag at the bottom of the body element, the dom is initialized until then, so it runs perfectly.
by default, type=module makes it defer. so we use type=module instead of defer. but there's a cache. modules require http to run. i.e. server to run. 
without http, it shows CORS, i.e. Cross Origin Request blocked. so to use modules we require http. as i opened the browser using the live server extension,
my link was http from beginning, 
so using modules didnt give me any error.
but if it would have been file://, it would have given CORS in the developer console.
and another thing. as my live server was using 3000 port.
when i used npm install -g serve, it gave me another port because 3000 was already running. -->

<!-- Summary: -->


<!-- ✅ Protocols

file:// → directly loading files from disk, no HTTP involved.

http:// → when using a local dev server (Live Server, serve, etc.), browser requests files via HTTP.

https:// → same as HTTP but encrypted. Not used by default for local dev unless you configure certificates.

✅ Classic scripts

<script src="..."></script> in <head> → runs immediately, DOM not ready → problem.

Solution:

Add defer → waits for DOM to be parsed.

OR move script to bottom of <body>.

✅ Module scripts

<script type="module" src="..."></script> →

Modules are deferred by default ✅.

No need for defer.

BUT require HTTP → otherwise file:// gives CORS errors. -->


<!-- Alright, here’s the rule of thumb 📝:

👉 If you’re using modern JavaScript (import, export, type="module") → always open your project with a local server (http://...).

👉 If you’re using a simple script without modules → you can open with file://, but make sure the DOM exists before your script runs (use defer or put script at bottom).

That’s it. 🚀
Everything else (CORS errors, DOM not ready, ports in use) is just a side effect of these two rules. -->
