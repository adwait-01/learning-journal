    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <!-- JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. 
    This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. 
    On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels. -->

    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>

    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <!-- GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for photos. 
    Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. 
    This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. 
    For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation. -->

    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>

    <!-- PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. 
    For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. 
    However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations. 
    This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc. -->


    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>

    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <!-- Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension 
    without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. 
    They’re good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can. -->

    <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.svg' width="150" alt="A mochi ball with Bezier handles">

    <!-- By default, the SVG image appears much smaller than the JPG, PNG & GIF images, even though we have added them the same way in our HTML file.
    This happens because SVGs are vector graphics, and by default, they dont have a fixed size like the raster images(JPG/PNG/GIF). If we dont explicitly 
    set a width and height for an SVG, it will renter at its intrinsic size which is quite small. -->

    <!-- There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your 
    image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). 
    If your images contain a lot of text, this can have a big impact on file size. -->

    <!-- The width and height attributes can be useful, but it’s usually better to set image dimensions with CSS so you can alter them with media queries. 
    We’ll discuss this in more detail once we get to responsive design. -->
