After watching a video, go through a little bit about the topics taught in the lecture, practice them, create few new files and explore a little bit on the documentation website or some more supplemental material. 

Remember, learning cannot be done by watching videos or content. We need to supplement it with little bit of reading on our own or documentation or practicing a little bit. 

Do not binge watch the videos.

Practice, Practice, Practice. 
We can always learn by doing, experimenting, and building new things. 

Learn on the go. Hit & trial stuff, comment out and see what's something doing particularly and what's not happening when it's not there.

Supplement these lectures with own learning as well.
e.g. Learn more about positions: absolute and relative positions.

Study more, document more. Try to experiment more with the code, that's the only way to learn.

The only way to learn is by doing.
