    <h1>Extras</h1>
    <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, 
        but you may also be interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or <a href='/3_InternetingIsHard-links-and-images/images.html'>images</a>.</p>

    <h2>Character Sets</h2>

    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>bir</li>
        <li>iki</li>
        <li>üç</li>
        <li>dört</li>
        <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- An “HTML entity” is a special character that can’t be represented as plain text in an HTML document. 
    This typically either means it’s a reserved character in HTML or you don’t have a key on your keyboard for it. -->

    <!-- Reserved Characters
    The <, >, and & characters are called “reserved characters” because they aren’t allowed to be inserted into an HTML document without being encoded. 
    This is because they mean something in the HTML syntax: < begins a new tag, > ends a tag, and, as we’re about to learn, & sets off an HTML entity. -->

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
        should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
        yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>

    <!-- In the olden days of the web, HTML files weren’t allowed to have special characters in them, making entities much more useful. 
    But, since we’re now using a UTF-8 character set, we should be able to insert any character directly into the HTML document. 
    This makes entities primarily useful as reserved characters or for convenience when authoring straight HTML. -->
